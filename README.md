# Advanced Front End Development

Welcome to the Advanced Front End Development! Let's review what we have learned so far, and go from there. We are going to improve our knowledge and understanding of HTML, CSS, and JS, learn about the new and modern CSS properties, see what is an SCSS preprocessor, and learn about the most popular JS frameworks.
